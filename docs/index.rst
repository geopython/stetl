Welcome to Stetl
================

Stetl, Streaming ETL, is an open source (GNU GPL) toolkit for the transformation (ETL)
of geospatial data.  Stetl is based on existing ETL tools like GDAL/OGR and
XSLT. Stetl processing is driven from a configuration (.ini) file.
Stetl is written in Python and in particular suited for processing GML.

This is the documentation of the Stetl toolkit.
The code is on GitHub: https://github.com/geopython/stetl. Since July 2016 the project is a proud
member of the `GeoPython GitHub organization <https://github.com/geopython>`_.

See an `introductory Stetl presentation on Slideshare <http://www.slideshare.net/justb4/geospatial-etl-with-stetl-geopython-2016>`_.
